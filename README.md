# 🏥 “A novel-inspired lab diary for AZ-104 — where patients are cloud resources, doctors are admins, and healing is learning.”
# 🏥✨ AZ-104 Admin Hospital Diaries 🌸🌷

Welcome to the **Azure Admin Hospital** — a place unlike any other.  
Here, patients are not people, but **Azure resources**.  
Doctors are not surgeons, but **Admins and Learners**.  
And treatments are not medicines, but **Labs and Configurations**.  

🌼 This is the hospital where a layman enters as a beginner…  
and walks out in just **3 weeks** as a confident **Azure Administrator**.  
Each of the **21 patients (labs)** is a case — a critical condition that demands your care.  
Every operation you perform brings you closer to mastery, one heartbeat at a time. ✨

## 🌸 The Promise of the Hospital 🌷  

This is not just a lab repo. It is a **healing journey**.  
Every patient you treat teaches you an **Azure skill**.  
Every heartbeat you monitor becomes a **command you master**.  
And by the end of three weeks, you will not only know the **AZ-104 exam**,  
but you will carry with you the story of how a **beginner was admitted… and an Azure Admin walked out.** ✨  

🌼 Step inside. Put on your white coat. Pick up your stethoscope of commands.  
The patients are waiting. 💖
