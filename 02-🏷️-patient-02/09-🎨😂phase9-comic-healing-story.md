# 🎨😂 Phase 9 – Comic-Style Healing Story  
*Patient 2: Working with Resource Tags*

---

## 🌟 Comic Story Setup
The hospital doors creaked open… and out stepped **Eks2**, still dizzy from interview stress.  
Suddenly — WHOOSH! 🌪️ — the whole Azure Admin Hospital team appeared like characters from a magical comic strip.  

- **I.K. 🧢** floated in the background, halo glowing: *“Children, even laughter is a teacher of light.”* ✨  
- **Eks2 🇩🇰** tripped over a cable: *“Oops, was that… production?!”*  
- **Sofia 🇪🇸** sipped tea calmly: *“No Eks2, that was just a demo group 🌸.”*  
- **Kasper 🇩🇰** swung a cricket bat at the Virtual Machine button: *“BOOM! Deployed faster than my sixer 🏏😂.”*  
- **Inky 🇪🇸/🇵🇰** ninja-flipped: *“WAIT! I sense… an untagged VM… HIIYAAA!”*  
- **Elina 🇷🇺** typed furiously: *“Relax, I scripted auto-tags already.”*  
- **Isabella 🇮🇹** hugged Eks2: *“Even mistakes are cute when you learn from them 💕.”*  
- **Maya 🇨🇳** giggled: *“I thought tags were like Instagram hashtags 😂📸.”*  
- **ShadowNet 🕶️** sneered: *“Muahaha, I’ll hide your VM without tags!”* — but slipped on a banana peel 🍌 and vanished with a *“WAAAHHHH!”*

## 🛠️ Comic Retelling of Lab Steps

### Step 1 – Create a Virtual Machine  
👉 Eks2 nervously clicked “Create VM.”  
Eks2: *“NordicVault-VM… okay, but… why does this feel like defusing a bomb?!”* 💣  
Sofia: *“It’s just Azure, Eks2. Breathe. 🌸”*  
Kasper: *“If it blows, we’ll just work at a bakery 🥖😂.”*

### Step 2 – Apply Tags  
Eks2 scribbled a tag: **Department = IT**.  
Inky leapt in with ninja eyes: *“WHAT IF HE FORGOT?!”*  
Elina rolled her eyes: *“I automated it. Chill.”* 💻  
Isabella smiled: *“This tag is like naming your child — it gives identity 🌼.”*  

---

### Step 3 – Filter by Tag  
Eks2 clicked filter and suddenly all resources appeared.  
Eks2 gasped: *“WOW! It’s like magic!”* 🪄  
Maya shouted: *“It’s like searching TikTok by hashtag! #AzureLife 💃.”*  
I.K. whispered: *“Filters reveal hidden order in chaos.”* 🌌  

---

### Step 4 – Delete All Resources  
Eks2 pressed delete, hands shaking.  
ShadowNet mocked: *“Delete? Oh no, you’ll crash everything!”*  
Eks2: *“I… I trust my learning.”* 🌸  
With one calm click, the resources were gone. BOOM! 💥  
The whole team cheered: *“Eks2 did it!”* 🎉

## 🎉 Closing Celebration
Music burst from nowhere. Kasper breakdanced. Maya did bhangra 💃.  
Inky spun like a Beyblade 🌀.  
Elina raised a banner: *“Automation Forever!”*  
Isabella showered flowers 🌷.  
Eks2 laughed for the first time in days — his confidence glowing like a star. 🌟  

And finally, **I.K. 🧢** spoke:  
*“Children, remember: even in comedy, learning is sacred. Laugh, love, and let Azure heal you.”* 🌼✨
