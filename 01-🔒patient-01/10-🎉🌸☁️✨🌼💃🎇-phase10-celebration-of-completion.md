# 🎉 Phase 10 – The Celebration of Completion 🌸✨
# 🌸✨ Patient 1 – Creating Azure Resource Locks 🌷🌼🧚‍♀

## 🌟 The Final Rise  
The ward was hushed, soft like dawn after rain. NordicVault-VM — the patient — slowly stood up from the hospital bed.  
The monitors blinked gently, petals swayed outside the window 🌼, and the sun spilled golden light through the glass 🌞.  

The patient whispered:  
**“I am ready… thank you, thank you all…”** 🌸
