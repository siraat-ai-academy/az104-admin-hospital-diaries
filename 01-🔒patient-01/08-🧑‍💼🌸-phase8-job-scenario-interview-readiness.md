## Job Scenario 1 – The Locked Patient Records
At **NordicCare Systems**, the HR department complains that their Virtual Machine, **NordicVault-VM**, suddenly cannot be deleted. Maya Lin nervously admits that during late-night practice, she added a **Delete Lock** on the VM without telling anyone. ShadowNet sneers, “Locks are chains — systems must suffocate!” Sofia smiles softly, “No, locks are like sutures, holding the wound together until it heals.” Kasper laughs, “If we can’t delete, at least the patient is alive!” Elina explains that locks are policies, not curses. Isabella adds, “This was protection, not punishment.” The interviewer leans forward and asks: *In a real corporate environment, how should the admin handle this situation wisely?*

A. Remove the lock immediately and delete the VM without discussion  
B. Keep the lock forever to avoid mistakes  
C. Review whether the VM is critical, then remove the lock only with approval  
D. Blame Maya and recreate the VM in another group  

✅ **Correct Answer & Explanation:**  
C is correct. In real workplaces, locks are safety nets. Healing means deciding with intention. Always review importance, seek approvals, then act calmly. 🌸 Locks are not prison bars — they are protective stitches.

## Job Scenario 2 – The Read-Only Silence
During an interview case study, Eks2 is asked about a **DKSec-Group** resource group that has a **Read-Only Lock** applied. Kasper jokes, “Even my football shots can’t change a file here!” Inky whispers, “But what if an emergency patch is needed?” Sofia explains gently, “This lock brings peace — no accidental harm.” ShadowNet mocks, “Peace is weakness!” Elina nods, “With scripts and proper planning, even locks can be managed wisely.” Isabella adds heart: “This is like guarding the patient’s diary.” The interviewer finally asks: *How should admins respond when urgent updates are needed in a locked resource group?*

A. Break the lock by force, update, then never add it again  
B. Remove the lock temporarily with approval, apply updates, then reapply  
C. Move all resources to a new unlocked group  
D. Ignore the patch — peace is better than change  

✅ **Correct Answer & Explanation:**

## Job Scenario 3 – The Phantom Backup
At **NordicVault Hospital**, Isabella discovers their **Backup Vault** has no retention rules.
