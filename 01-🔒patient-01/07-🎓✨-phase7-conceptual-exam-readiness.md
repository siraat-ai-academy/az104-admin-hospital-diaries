# 🌸✨ Patient 1 – Creating Azure Resource Locks 🌷🌼🧚‍♀

---

Here are **10 soulful, scenario-based MCQs** designed like stories in the Azure Admin Hospital, each carrying wisdom, humor, and reflection. 🌷  

---

## MCQ 1: The Case of the Forgotten Lock  
At DKSec Hospital, **Maya Lin** excitedly created a new **Virtual Machine (NordicVault-VM)** for testing. In her joy, she forgot to add a **Delete Lock**. Later that night, **ShadowNet** whispered, “A tired admin may click the wrong button… and poof, your patient will vanish.” **Eks2** grew worried: “But how do we truly protect it?” **Kasper** teased, “We can’t bubble-wrap everything!” while **Sofia** added calmly, “Locks are compassion — for our future selves.” The team debated: should they rebuild backup strategies, trust permissions alone, or add the lock?  

What is the wisest healing choice?  
A. Rely only on RBAC permissions to prevent deletion  
B. Add a **Delete Lock** to the VM  
C. Create daily snapshots as the only protection  
D. Trust admins to be careful without safeguards  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**B is correct.** A **Delete Lock** directly prevents accidental deletion. While RBAC and backups matter, the essence of healing here is prevention of careless harm. 🌸 Locks are love, stitched into Azure.  

---

## MCQ 2: The Read-Only Dilemma  
**Isabella Konti** noticed that the **DKSec-Group** was being updated too frequently by interns, risking chaos. **Inky Rihan** warned: “One wrong tweak, and the whole ward breaks.” **Maya** defended, “But how will I learn if I can’t try?” **Sofia** smiled: “Learning and protecting can both live together.” The debate began: should they freeze the group with a **Read-Only Lock**, delete resources, or redesign access?  

What should they do?  
A. Apply a **Read-Only Lock** at the resource group level  
B. Delete all intern accounts to avoid risk  
C. Allow interns free access and hope for the best  
D. Move resources to another subscription  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**A is correct.** A **Read-Only Lock** allows viewing but prevents modification. It is the gentle pause of Azure — protecting without silencing curiosity. 🌷  

---

## MCQ 3: ShadowNet’s Shortcut  
**ShadowNet** tempted the team: “Locks are just extra clicks. Remove them, life becomes faster.” **Kasper** laughed, “Yes, until you lose your entire patient!” **Elina** said firmly: “Speed without structure is chaos.” **Eks2** asked: “So, are locks performance tools?”  

What is the real truth?  
A. Locks improve performance of resources  
B. Locks prevent accidental or unauthorized changes/deletion  
C. Locks replace RBAC entirely  
D. Locks encrypt the VM for security  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**B is correct.** Locks are not about performance or encryption, but about **safeguarding state**. They are guardrails of care. ✨  

---

## MCQ 4: The Emergency Unlock  
A storm hit **NordicVault-VM**. **Inky** tested failovers, but a **Delete Lock** prevented deletion during a recovery process. **Maya** panicked: “Are we stuck forever?” **Sofia** calmed her: “Locks are firm, not eternal.” **Elina** whispered: “Every lock can be unlocked — with intention.”  

What is the right action here?  
A. Locks can never be removed once applied  
B. Locks can be removed, but only with permission and intention  
C. Locks auto-remove after 24 hours  
D. Locks are bypassed during emergencies automatically  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**B is correct.** Locks can be lifted — but deliberately. Healing means balance: protect, but also adapt when needed. 🌼  

---

## MCQ 5: The Resource Group Puzzle  
**Eks2** asked: “If we add a **Read-Only Lock** on DKSec-Group, does it also lock the **NordicVault-VM** inside?” **Kasper** joked: “Like locking the hospital door — no one can reach the patients.” **Isabella** added: “But they are still visible — just safe.”  

What is true?  
A. Locks only affect the resource group metadata  
B. Locks apply to both the resource group and all resources inside  
C. Locks do not cascade into resources inside  
D. Locks block even visibility of resources  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**B is correct.** Locks cascade — protecting the group and all children within. They are blankets of care, not just signs on doors. 🌸  

---

## MCQ 6: The Backup Misunderstanding  
**Maya** asked: “If I place a **Delete Lock**, do I still need backups?” **ShadowNet** sneered: “No, one is enough.” **Sofia** explained: “A lock prevents deletion, but does not protect against corruption.” **Inky** nodded: “Both must walk together.”  

What should Maya do?  
A. Rely only on Delete Lock for safety  
B. Use both Delete Locks and Backup strategies  
C. Use only backups, not locks  
D. Ignore both; trust her instincts  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**B is correct.** Locks and backups are companions. One prevents mistakes, the other heals when mistakes slip through. 🌷  

---

## MCQ 7: The Multi-Admin Chaos  
At DKSec Hospital, five admins managed the same **VM**. **ShadowNet** whispered confusion: “Too many hands, too many slips.” **Elina** advised structure. **Isabella** worried about empathy for new learners. The question: should they use **RBAC**, **Locks**, both, or none?  

What is wise?  
A. Use only RBAC, ignore locks  
B. Use only locks, ignore RBAC  
C. Use both RBAC and Locks together  
D. Do nothing; trust teamwork  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**C is correct.** Locks and RBAC are complementary. One guides access, the other guards against accidents. True healing blends discipline with compassion. 🌸  

---

## MCQ 8: The Accidental Architect  
**Maya** accidentally deployed **NordicVault-VM** in the wrong subscription. **Kasper** chuckled: “Rookie sixer — hit in the wrong direction!” **Sofia** suggested a move, **Elina** reminded structure, while **Inky** warned of risks. What should they do?  

A. Delete and scold Maya  
B. Move the VM resources safely using portal or CLI  
C. Leave it as is; mistakes are lessons  
D. Ignore and rebuild when issues arise  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**B is correct.** Healing means correction, not punishment. Move operations realign resources gently without waste. 🌼  

---

## MCQ 9: ShadowNet’s Mockery of Read-Only  
**ShadowNet** mocked: “Read-Only Locks just slow admins down.” **Eks2** asked: “But don’t they save us from mistakes?” **Sofia** smiled: “Locks are pauses, not prisons.” The team debated: do locks block deletion, updates, or both?  

A. Read-Only locks prevent deletion and modification  
B. Read-Only locks prevent modification, but not deletion  
C. Read-Only locks only affect metadata, not actions  
D. Read-Only locks encrypt resources automatically  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**B is correct.** Read-Only locks block changes but allow deletion if the group itself is deleted. Subtle, like silence that still holds risk. 🌷  

---

## MCQ 10: The Invisible Captain’s Lesson  
At the ward’s end, **I.K.** gathered the team: “Locks are not just features. They are symbols.” The stars glowed as **Eks2** asked: “What do they symbolize most?” **Isabella** smiled: “Compassion.” **Elina** added: “Structure.” **Kasper** laughed: “Guardrails.” **ShadowNet** sneered: “Chains.”  

What truth shines brightest?  
A. Locks are about control  
B. Locks are about punishment  
C. Locks are about protection and prevention  
D. Locks are about performance boost  

✅ Correct Answer & Explanation:  
**C is correct.** Locks are guardians of prevention, not chains of punishment. 🌸 They are prayers in Azure, reminding admins: “Care is the deepest skill.”
