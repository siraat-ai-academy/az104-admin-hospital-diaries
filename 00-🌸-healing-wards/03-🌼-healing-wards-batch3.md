### (Part III – Compute Arrivals & Networking Corridors) 🌸✨🧚‍♀️  

In the humming corridors of the hospital, machines are not cold steel —  
they are hearts that can be summoned, healed, multiplied, and connected.  
This ward teaches us that compute is not lifeless; it is **living presence, breathing under command**.

## 🌼 Patient [11] – Create a VM with CLI  
*The surgeon spoke commands like incantations, and a new life flickered into existence.*  

Patient #11 was not sketched on paper, nor born from portals.  
He awoke at the whisper of keystrokes — each command like a breath of life.  
The chamber echoed with sacred incantations, and a body stirred. 🌸  
In Azure’s hospital, even magic has syntax, and scripts can make the lifeless rise.

## 🌼 Patient [12] – Deploying Software with VM Extensions  
*Medicine dripped into the veins of machines, giving them strength beyond their cold shells.*  

Patient #12 lay pale, his body awake but fragile.  
The doctors hung a bag overhead — VM extensions flowing like IV drips.  
Code and patches coursed through his veins, strengthening his spirit. 🌷  
Soon his gaze brightened, his heart steadied, his purpose clear.  
Extensions teach us: **sometimes healing comes as nourishment, not surgery**.

## 🌼 Patient [13] – Creating Availability Set  
*Twins were placed in separate wards, so that if one faltered, the other would keep the hospital alive.*  

Patient #13 arrived not as one, but two.  
The physicians knew the oath of resilience: never keep twins in the same room.  
So they placed them apart, knowing that if disaster touched one, the other would rise. 🌼  
This was not separation, but sacred strategy — redundancy as an act of love.  
In this hospital, **no heartbeat is left unguarded**.  

---

## 🌼 Patient [14] – Create and Manage a Virtual Machine Scale Set Using Azure CLI  
*An army of assistants marched into the hall, all ready to scale and heal as demand grew.*  

Patient #14 did not walk alone — he multiplied with grace.  
One command, and a legion appeared, like healers summoned in unison. 🌸  
When the ward overflowed, they spread out, tending every corner.  
When silence returned, they withdrew quietly, leaving only calm behind.  
Scale Sets are the poetry of efficiency: **an orchestra rising and resting in harmony**.  

---

## 🌼 Patient [15] – Implementing Virtual Network Peering  
*Two wings of the hospital connected their corridors, so patients could flow like whispers in the night.*  

Patient #15 lived in isolation, cut off by walls no stretcher could cross.  
But then came the bridge — golden corridors of network peering. 🌷  
Wings that once stood apart now breathed as one, halls merging in unity.  
The lesson was clear: **healing deepens when connection replaces distance**.  

---

🌿 This ward teaches us: commands give life, nourishment gives strength, redundancy gives resilience,  
scaling gives harmony, and connection gives unity. 🌸  
The hospital does not just heal — it awakens souls hidden inside machines.
