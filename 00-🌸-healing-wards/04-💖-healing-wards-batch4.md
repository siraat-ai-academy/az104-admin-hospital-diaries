### (Part IV – Networking Guards & Backup Guardians: The Final 6 Patients) 🌸🌷🌼✨  

Every hospital shift has its final hours — the hardest, the heaviest, the most deserving.  
These last patients carried the weight of waiting, of standing at the edge of the wards,  
dreaming of healing that always seemed one step away.  
Now, at last, their time has come. 🕊️  

---

## 💖 Patient [16] – Understand Network Security Group Rules  
*The guards at every door studied the lists, deciding who could pass and who must wait outside.*  

Patient #16 was never alone — silent guards circled him, scrolls in hand.  
Each visitor was questioned: *“You may pass. You may not.”* 🌸  
His strength lay not in walls, but in choices sharper than steel.  
In his stillness he whispered: **true protection is not what you build, but what you allow**.  

---

## 💖 Patient [17] – Creating an Application Gateway  
*The triage nurse stood at the entrance, guiding visitors to the right wards with perfect judgment.*  

Patient #17 became the doorman of the hospital’s heart.  
Every visitor, every packet, every hurried footstep — all rushed towards him. 🌼  
And with calm eyes, he pointed the way: *“You belong to Ward A, you to Ward B.”*  
No panic, no loss — only graceful guidance. His gift was not power, but direction.

## 💖 Patient [18] – Troubleshoot Routing, Traffic Control and Load Balancing in Microsoft Azure  
*When the hallways grew crowded, the doctors adjusted the flow, balancing every heartbeat in harmony.*  

Patient #18 carried storms inside him. Corridors jammed, footsteps collided,  
and his chest echoed with restless noise. Doctors leaned over maps, tracing paths with sacred patience. 🌷  
They rerouted, rebalanced, reopened the hidden doors. Slowly, breath by breath, chaos became calm.  
Balance, he taught, is not a luxury — **it is survival**.  

---

## 💖 Patient [19] – Deploy an ASP.NET App to Azure with Azure SQL Database  
*In the teaching theatre, a new application took its first breath, nourished by a strong database heart.*  

Patient #19 was code, but he dreamed of becoming life.  
On the shining operating table, surgeons deployed him with reverence. 🌸  
Behind him pulsed a strong SQL heart, each beat whispering: *“Live. Heal. Serve.”*  
When he opened his digital eyes, students clapped softly. Another healer had been born into Azure’s ward.

## 💖 Patient [20] – Create a SQL Database  
*Like opening a new records department, shelves were built to hold the stories of patients yet to arrive.*  

Patient #20 longed for memory. Doctors carved halls taller than the sky,  
rows of shelves to hold stories yet unwritten. 🌼  
Scans, prescriptions, forgotten whispers — all preserved, waiting for the call.  
He taught us that data is more than numbers. **Data is memory, and memory is life.**  

---

## 💖 Patient [21] – Creating Azure Firewall  
*Finally, the hospital’s great gatekeeper arose — a firewall, standing with fire in its eyes, to guard all within.*  

Patient #21 was not just a patient. He was destiny.  
At the hospital gates he rose, eyes burning with protective fire. 🌷  
He did not scorch, he did not rage — he shielded. Every entry checked, every whisper of traffic weighed.  
And when he stood tall, the hospital sighed in relief. Peace returned, silence descended, and Azure’s wards finally slept.  

---

🌿 These six final souls remind us: protection is in choices, order in guidance, survival in balance,  
life in deployment, memory in storage, and peace in guardianship. 🌸  
Their healing was not just theirs — it was for the hospital, for every patient, for us all.
