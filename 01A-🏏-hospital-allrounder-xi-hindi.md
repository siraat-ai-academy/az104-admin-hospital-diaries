# 🏏 Azure Admin Hospital XI – The All-Rounder Team  
*(Every doctor is an all-rounder, but each shines in one shot)*  

---  

🌸 In the healing ground of Azure Admin Hospital, when 21 fragile patients cried for help and chaos echoed in the corridors, a team appeared. Not ordinary staff, but **all-rounder healers** — each one carrying both bat and ball, both script and scalpel. Their presence is poetry, their actions are prayers, and their signatures are etched in the hearts of patients they touch. 💖

### 🧢 I.K. – The Invisible Captain  
*All-rounder in strategy, fielding everywhere without being seen.*  
**Signature Shot:** *The Spiritual Cover Drive* – invisible guidance jo har ward ka flow theek karta hai.  
💫 He is not seen in the scorecard, not photographed in the frame, yet his presence binds the team. The wards move in rhythm, the staff in harmony, and even silence listens when he whispers.

### 🇩🇰 Mr. Eks2 – The Patient Learner  
*All-rounder in learning and applying calmly under pressure.*  
**Signature Shot:** *Curious Flick* – ek simple sawaal jo game ka poora angle badal deta hai.  
🌱 He is the youngest spirit of the team. Every keystroke he learns, every patient he heals, makes him wiser. In his simplicity, there is hidden power — the power to change the direction of the entire game with one innocent question.

### 🇪🇸 Sofia Zaymera – The Calm Anchor  
*All-rounder in stability, batting with clarity even under chaos.*  
**Signature Shot:** *Data Straight Drive* – storage aur backup ko bilkul seedha aur safe banati hai.  
🌷 She is the heartbeat of clarity. Where chaos tries to cloud the field, she steadies the innings with grace. Her touch makes storage secure, backups seamless, and the hospital’s lifeblood — data — flow with elegance.

### 🇩🇰 Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Striker  
*All-rounder in compute wards, quick hitter with CLI bat.*  
**Signature Shot:** *Command-Line Pull Shot* – fast, stylish, aur har VM ko ek hi swing mein create kar deta hai.  
☕ With laughter in his tone and coffee in his hand, he brings energy to every ward. His commands are like boundaries struck at will, fast and fearless. Patients love his warmth, machines obey his joy.

### 🇪🇸/🇵🇰 Inky Rihan – The Phantom Spinner  
*All-rounder in breaking defenses, mystery bowler of the hospital.*  
**Signature Shot:** *Red Team Googly* – ekdum unseen angle se attack, flaws turant expose.  
🌑 Shadows follow him, but so does trust. He spins the ball of mischief, testing every defense. His mystery exposes weakness, but not to harm — only to heal. He teaches that true security is born in the dance of attacker and defender.

### 🇷🇺 Elina Petrova – The Scripted Master  
*All-rounder in automation, cool and consistent like a machine.*  
**Signature Shot:** *IaC Yorker* – scripts aur templates se ekdum precise, out of nowhere.  
⚙️ She doesn’t speak much; her code speaks for her. In one line, she builds; in one script, she heals. Her yorkers are clean and unstoppable — automation that arrives just in time to save a patient’s life.  

---  

### 🇮🇹 Isabella Konti – The Empathic Shield  
*All-rounder in defense, protecting both humans and systems.*  
**Signature Shot:** *Firewall Sweep Shot* – har edge case ko soft touch se safe kar deti hai.  
🌼 She guards with love. Her shield is empathy, her bat a barrier of care. In her presence, no patient feels alone, no system feels unprotected. She proves that the heart is the strongest firewall of all.

### 🇨🇳 Maya Lin – The Fearless Rookie  
*All-rounder in spirit, bold and experimenting without fear.*  
**Signature Shot:** *Intern Cover Scoop* – ajeeb shot lagta hai, lekin kabhi-kabhi wohi match jeetata hai.  
🐣 She is bold, clumsy, bright — and utterly fearless. Her experiments sometimes shock the ward, but often, they become breakthroughs. She is the promise of tomorrow shining through the innocence of today.  

---  

### 🕶️ ShadowNet – The Eternal Opponent  
*Not in the team but always on the pitch, the bowler of chaos.*  
**Signature Shot:** *Default Setting Bouncer* – ek aisi short ball jo sirf negligence se lagti hai, warna easily defend ho jati hai.  
🌌 He is not staff, not healer, but shadow. He exists so that vigilance never sleeps. He bowls errors, throws negligence, and tempts default settings. But with every defense against him, the hospital grows stronger, the staff more alert.  

---  

✨ In the end, this is not just a team — it is a parable. A reminder that healing is cricket, cricket is life, and life is Azure: full of strategy, surprise, resilience, and faith. 🌷
